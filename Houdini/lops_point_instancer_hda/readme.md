# LOPs Point Instancer

The lops point instancer hda is meant to generate points inside of a instancer lop with random scale values. This setup is originally designed place books on shelves and works with a USD file containing a number of variants which are all the same "width" so that they can be scaled up by attributes. Note this is not very well optimized at the moment.
